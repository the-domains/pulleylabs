# Welcome to PulleyLabs

Hi. We're Pulley Labs, a small high-tech company that focuses on enabling growth at scale within our venture client's portfolio companies.

Why the name "PulleyLabs" you ask? Because a pulley enables you to move or lift something with less effort. PulleyLabs provides the ability for our client's startups to **do****more of the right thing _faster_**.

We're comprised of a group of folks who've had the chance to do quite a lot in our respective careers and have learned a lot of hard lessons along the way - experience and knowledge we share with our clients to make them even more successful, without repeating our mistakes. Yet, we also remain true believers in "failing fast" to get to success.

We're the pulley, our client's are the rope, and together we're moving the portfolio startups to growth faster.
